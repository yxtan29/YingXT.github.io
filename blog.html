      <h3>The Beginning of File-Sharing</h3>
      <p>Today in the modern world, we have the luxury of not only carrying, but also accessing music on
        the spot at the touch of our fingertips through our mobile devices and other electronics. From
        Spotify to YouTube, we have access to thousands of musician’s work and more. All these modern music
        sharing platforms are only possible with the existence of the internet and file sharing, which
        surprisingly was about 50 years ago. <br>
        <br>
        Before there were digital files, music was shared through broadcasting stations and radio. Much
        like olden times, music came from single sources that would be shared and played for large groups.
        Whether it be radio or vinyl records, the technology did not allow portability and quick access like
        it does today. But as technology advances, the invention of cassette tapes and the Walkman allowed
        portability, as well as individualized music listening experience. <br>
        <br>
        Digital file sharing started around the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the same time as the
        introduction of compact discs (CDs). Compact discs was developed to play and store audio recordings
        and was then developed into CD-ROM which was adopted for data storage that has a larger capacity
        than computer hard drives at that time. Just like they would putting a microphone from the tape
        recorder to the radio to record onto their cassette tapes, people are recording down their favorite
        songs into CDs with its new feature and capacity. <br>
        <br>
        During the 1980s, file sharing was done by modem over landline telephone where computer memory and
        speed is very limited and can only support files with short filenames. It wasn’t until the 1990s
        when the World Wide Web was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau that digitalized music
        begins to take form. On December 1991, the Moving Pictures Experts Group chose an audio codec
        developed by Karlheinz Brandenburg, and with input from AT&T and Thomson, to serve as the MP3
        standard. This is the first step into digital music files as this technology allows songs on CDs to
        be converted into small computer files.

      <h3>Napster</h3>
      <p>Napster began as a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing network that focuses on sharing digital audio
        files in MP3 formats. The platform allowed users to share their MP3 files with other participants
        within that same network. Many music fans recall the sense of liberation when Napster was launched,
        marking as the day music was set free. The service was developed by two teenagers in 1999,
        co-founders Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, revolutionizing the way in which we share music. The
        idea of Napster began in 1998 when Sean Parker, whose username was also called “napster” on internet
        chatrooms, shared how he was working on a piece of software that would create a platform service for
        music sharing. This platform was designed as a search and index program allowing people to reach into
        each other’s hard drive where the participants can share their MP3 music files. Parker eventually
        teamed with Shawn Fanning, who helped work the software through borrowing a computer in his uncle’s
        office in Massachusetts. By spring 1999 the product was finished and officially launched in June 1999.
        Napster became a phenomenon on the world wide web. Just by opening a free account, millions of users
        gain easy access to millions of audio files. At the peak of Napster’s popularity, there were about 80
        million users registered on the network. Due to the immense amount of people using Napster, colleges
        began blocking the service due to network congestion. <br>
        <br>
        Napster was built on the young idea of easy file sharing and love for music. Much like the users,
        the amateur developers were unaware of the incoming copyright lawsuit. This began when heavy metal
        band Metallica discovered their song demo, “I Disappear,” has been circulating through the web
        before it was released, which eventually revealed their back catalog of studio material was also
        available. On March 2000, Metallica filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement and unlawful use of
        digital audio interface devices. Music producer Dr. Dre, who happened to share the same legal firm
        as Metallica, filed a similar lawsuit following Metallica’s. In 2000, the Recording Industry
        Association of America (RIAA) also sued Napster for copyright infringement and unlawful distribution,
        to which Napster lost and paid $26 million to settle legal disputes. During the last hours of Napster,
        millions of users were scrambling to download the last couple files before it was shut down in July
        2001.<br>
