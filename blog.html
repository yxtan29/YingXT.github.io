      <h3>The Beginning of File-Sharing</h3>
      <p>Today in the modern world, we have the luxury of not only carrying, but also accessing music on
        the spot at the touch of our fingertips through our mobile devices and other electronics. From
        Spotify to YouTube, we have access to thousands of musician’s work and more. All these modern music
        sharing platforms are only possible with the existence of the internet and file sharing, which
        surprisingly was about 50 years ago. <br>
        <br>
        Before there were digital files, music was shared through broadcasting stations and radio. Much
        like olden times, music came from single sources that would be shared and played for large groups.
        Whether it be radio or vinyl records, the technology did not allow portability and quick access like
        it does today. But as technology advances, the invention of cassette tapes and the Walkman allowed
        portability, as well as individualized music listening experience. <br>
        <br>
        Digital file sharing started around the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the same time as the
        introduction of compact discs (CDs). Compact discs was developed to play and store audio recordings
        and was then developed into CD-ROM which was adopted for data storage that has a larger capacity
        than computer hard drives at that time. Just like they would putting a microphone from the tape
        recorder to the radio to record onto their cassette tapes, people are recording down their favorite
        songs into CDs with its new feature and capacity. <br>
        <br>
        During the 1980s, file sharing was done by modem over landline telephone where computer memory and
        speed is very limited and can only support files with short filenames. It wasn’t until the 1990s
        when the World Wide Web was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau that digitalized music
        begins to take form. On December 1991, the Moving Pictures Experts Group chose an audio codec
        developed by Karlheinz Brandenburg, and with input from AT&T and Thomson, to serve as the MP3
        standard. This is the first step into digital music files as this technology allows songs on CDs to
        be converted into small computer files.
