      <h3>The Beginning of File-Sharing</h3>
      <h4> By Ying Tan <br>

      <p>Today in the modern world, we have the luxury of not only carrying, but also accessing music on
        the spot at the touch of our fingertips through our mobile devices and other electronics. From
        Spotify to YouTube, we have access to thousands of musician’s work and more. All these modern music
        sharing platforms are only possible with the existence of the internet and file sharing platform
        service developing during to 1980s and 1990s. </p>
        <p>Before there were digital files, music was shared through broadcasting stations and radio.
          Much like olden times, music came from single sources that would be shared and played for
          large groups. Whether it be radio or vinyl records, the technology did not allow portability
          and quick access like it does today. But as technology advances, the invention of cassette
          tapes and the Walkman allowed portability, as well as individualized music listening experience. </p>
          <p>Digital file sharing started around the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the same time as
            the introduction of compact discs (CDs). Compact discs was developed to play and store
            audio recordings and was then developed into CD-ROM, which was adopted for data storage
            that has a larger capacity than computer hard drives. Just like they would put a microphone
            from the tape recorder to the radio to record onto their cassette tapes, people are recording
            down their favorite songs into CDs with its new feature and capacity. </p>
            <p>During the 1980s, file sharing was done by modem over landline telephone where computer
              memory and speed is very limited and can only support files with short filenames.
              It wasn’t until the 1990s when the World Wide Web was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee
              and Robert Cailliau that digitalized music begins to take form. On December 1991,
              the Moving Pictures Experts Group chose an audio codec developed by Karlheinz Brandenburg,
              and with input from AT&T and Thomson, to serve as the MP3 standard. This is the first step
              into digital music files as this technology allows songs on CDs to be converted
              into small computer files. </p>
