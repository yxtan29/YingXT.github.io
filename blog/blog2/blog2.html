      <h3>Napster</h3>
      <h4> By Ying Tan <br>

      <p>Napster began as a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing network that focuses on sharing digital audio
        files in MP3 formats. The platform allowed users to share their MP3 files with other participants
        within that same network. Many music fans recall the sense of liberation when Napster was launched,
        marking as the day music was set free. The service was developed by two teenagers in 1999,
        co-founders Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, revolutionizing the way in which we share music.</p>
        <p>The idea of Napster began in 1998 when Sean Parker, whose username was also called “napster”
          on internet chatrooms, shared how he was working on a piece of software that would create a platform
          service for music sharing. This platform was designed as a search and index program allowing people to
          reach into each other’s hard drive where the participants can share their MP3 music files.
          Parker eventually teamed with Shawn Fanning, who helped work the software through borrowing a
          computer in his uncle’s office in Massachusetts. By spring 1999 the product was finished and
          officially launched in June 1999. Napster became a phenomenon on the world wide web. Just by opening a free
          account, millions of users gain easy access to millions of audio files. At the peak of Napster’s popularity,
          there were about 80 million users registered on the network. Due to the immense amount of people using Napster,
          colleges began blocking the service due to network congestion. </p>
          <p>Napster was built on the young idea of easy file sharing and love for music.
            Much like the users, the amateur developers were unaware of the incoming copyright lawsuit.
            This began when heavy metal band Metallica discovered their song demo, “I Disappear,” has been circulating
            through the web before it was released, which eventually revealed their back catalog of studio material was
            also available. On March 2000, Metallica filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement and unlawful use of digital audio
            interface devices. Music producer Dr. Dre, who happened to share the same legal firm as Metallica, filed a similar
            lawsuit following Metallica’s. In 2000, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) also sued Napster for
            copyright infringement and unlawful distribution, to which Napster lost and paid $26 million to settle legal disputes.
            During the last hours of Napster, millions of users were scrambling to download the last couple files before
            it was shut down in July 2001. </p>
