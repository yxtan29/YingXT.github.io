          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>Design a book using the provided text and images from Paul Rand's book "Design and the Play Instinct" using
            only one typeface, and one other color to go along with black, white, and gray to develop a strong visual concept
            utilizing a grid system in the design of a delightful book. The book can be any size and have as many pages as needed
            as long as it contains all of the provided materials. Only certain pictures are allowed for color and minimal
            modification changes. And finally, the book must also contain a front and back cover, title page, colophon, and citation
            page on top of the main content pages.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p> The project is done over a long span of time that has been split into multiple phases
            My goal is to utilize my knowledge in InDesign and typography to push the boundaries despite the
            limitations on the content and use of tools and colors.
            <br><br>
            The first phase is figuring out and deciding on a book size using white models, along with
            drawing out thumbnail size sketches to visualize the layouts of the content. I decided to size
            my book at 9.5x7in in landscape format, where it's big enough for the different images and text,
            but also smaller than regular 8.5x11 white printer paper. Additionally, I chose a black, white, and
            red color scheme that will give me a simple, clean, yet dynamic look.
            <br><br>
            The second phase consisted of the introduction to using grids to help guide us in layouts to develop
            consistency in he book. During this phase, the book is moved onto the computer using Adobe InDesign.
            InDesign is a platform for editorial work, allowing organization of pages, spreads, multiple layers of
            content, and grid layouts. In addition, more sketches are drawn out in a half-size scale and as spreads.
            <br><br>
            The next phase requires us to explore the typeface choices which includes Frutiger, Futura, Gill Sans,
            Helvetica Neue, Rockwell, and Univers. For my book, I chose Helvetica for its various weights.
            With the type decided, the second to last phase is the mockups where we print out the soon-to-be final draft
            multiple times to see whether the layout and design is to our liking. And finally, with everything set in stone,
            the final version is printed and bound into a book.
