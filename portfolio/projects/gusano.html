          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>Design a brand for an edible product that is consisted or made of an edible insect.
          Brand must include logo, information card, business system, and packaging. </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p> My product are seasonings made of insects called Agave Worms. My aim is to transform
            and elevate the status of edible insects by presenting a different format in the way
            insects can be seen as food. Insects are rarely considered and often viewed negatively
            as part of a food because the concept of edible insects is still fairly new.
            People are not very open or often hesitant to try and implement insects into their diet.
            The goal and purpose of Gusano is to give direction to steer away from that persepective.
            The designer is responsible for the creation of a strong and considerate brand,
            including an interesting packaing utilizing sustainable materials.<br>
            <br>

              Insects are often turned away in terms of considering it as a food source despite studies
              showing the high protein and sustainable food option. More than often, it is the perception
              of the grimy, ground crawling imagery that most people hold onto. Gusano Seasonings solves
              this problem by taking insects and familiar ingredients and flavors and combining them into
              a food product. By introducing the old with the new and the new with the old, it is the first
              step in reintroducing edible insects in a brighter light. Gusano utilizes common ingredients
              such as salt, chili peppers, and lime as a reassuring clutch for consumers, yet can still be
              adventurous with trying a edible insects.
