      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p> You were not notified. You received no call or mail informing you. Floods of emotions comes crashing dowm: shock, confusion, relief, happiness, excitement.
        All of these emotions balled up in the pit of your stomach. Though you are happy, it faded as fast as it appeared. You were not ready. You don't know how to face him.
        Not today, you weren't ready. You don't know what to say. Not today, you weren't ready. Why? Why weren't you informed ahead of time? You were not prepared.
        But most of all, he's not ready. He's not informed. He doesn't know. How will you tell him? How can you explain how greedy and selfish you were? How will he ever accept
        this new guest that intruded into your home and your heart. He can't, and he won't.
        But nevertheless, you have to go and pick him up. Jumping into the shower, you scrubbed as if your life depended on it, to which it did. Putting on a fresh set of clothes, perfume followed next.
        The entire room was swept throughout to clean up all the fallen items on the floor and doused in air freshener to hide the unfamiliar smell. With one last look, you headed down to the airport to pick him up.
        He was relieved and estatic, but he does not know. He was happily chattering away, unbeknownst of what awaits him. You tried, tried, and tried, but your mouth is left hanging with no words coming out.
        You don't know how to tell him, and it was too late. He twisted the door knob, and with on motion, he stepped into your house. No amount air freshener can mask it. It was too late. As your new lover steps out,
        he tilted his head back, eyes squinting, eyebrows furrowing, mouth dragging open, and with on downward motion, he sneezed. Your new little love made their appearance, tail wagging excitedly and happily thumping forward.
        They finally meet. There's nothing more to say. Your boyfriend continues sneezing and sneezing like a hailstorm. As your new puppy waddles forward attempting to properly meet the new human in the house,
        your boyfriend scrambles backward. Though he does not object to new little guest, he cannot have the puppy come up to him for he is plagued with an unfortunate dog allergy.
