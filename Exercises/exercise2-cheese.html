      <h2> <font face="helvetica"> Introduction </font> </h2>
      <p> <font face="helvetica">Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and
        forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually
        the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and
        adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form.
        Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature. <br>
          Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors
          depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized,
          the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke
          may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester,
          is produced by adding annatto. </font> </p>

          <h2> <font face="helvetica"> History </font> </h2>

          <h3> <font face="helvetica"> Origins </font> </h3>
          <p> <font face="helvetica"> Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive
            evidence indicating where cheese making originated, either in Europe, Central Asia or the
            Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according
            to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came
            into being. </font> </p>

          <h3> <font face="helvetica"> Ancient Greece and Rome </font></h3>
          <p> <font face="helvetica"> Ancient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese. Homer's Odyssey
            (8th century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese. </font> </p>

          <h3> <font face="helvetica"> Post-Roman Europe </font> </h3>
          <p> <font face="helvetica"> As Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbors, bringing their
            own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own unrelated words for cheese,
            cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive
            traditions and products. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers would encounter
            unfamiliar cheeses: Charlemagne's first encounter with a white cheese that had an edible rind
            forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's Life of the Emperor. </font> </p>

          <h3> <font face="helvetica"> Modern era </font> </h3>
          <p> <font face="helvetica"> Until its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in east
            Asian cultures, in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean
            Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe, the Middle East, the Indian
            subcontinent, and areas influenced by those cultures. But with the spread, first of European
            imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known
            and increasingly popular worldwide, though still rarely considered a part of local ethnic
            cuisines outside Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and the Americas. </font> </p>
